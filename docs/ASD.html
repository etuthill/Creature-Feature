								<b> Sprint 1 Mechanical Design</b><br>
								During our first sprint, we were mainly ideating on what behaviors we wanted the creature to have and how we wanted to go about making those behaviors possible. 
								We wanted to have a system that is able to do multiple motions with a limited amount of components since the design has very firm space constraints. 
								We also wanted to design the creature to be able to be able to revert back to its original standing position after a behavior ended.<br>
								Our original design included a spine made up of 6 servos. We created the boxy shape of the creature by attaching the frame to the servos which allows
								it to have both a distinct shape and a moveable body. We considered having the beak be able to open and close via cam when it sensed that food was in its beak. Another mechanical 
								aspect we explored was having the creature be able to vibrate by using a DC motor.
