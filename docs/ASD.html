							<p> This shows our sprint 1 prototype in action. It is using a placeholder infrared sensor to sense when something covers it in shadow. When it senses that, the servos stop moving and the LED
							goes from green to red to symbolize that it is stopped.</p>

								<p>During our first sprint, we were mainly ideating on what behaviors we wanted the creature to have and how we wanted to go about making those behaviors possible. 
								We wanted to have a system that is able to do multiple motions with a limited amount of components since the design has very firm space constraints. 
								We also wanted to design the creature to be able to be able to revert back to its original standing position after a behavior ended.<br><br>
								Our original design included a spine made up of six servos. We created the boxy shape of the creature by attaching the frame to the servos which allows
								it to have both a distinct shape and a moveable body. We considered having the beak be able to open and close via cam when it sensed that food was in its beak. Another mechanical 
								aspect we explored was having the creature be able to vibrate by using a DC motor.<br><br>
								We chose six servos because we could have three servos move in one axis and the other three servos move in another axis. This would allow the creature to bend forward and wiggle around.
								We wanted it to bend over and go to sleep when a blanket was put on it and we wanted it to wiggle when it felt happy or excited.</p>

								<p>Between our first and second sprint, we decided to make a pretty big pivot in our mechanical design. After discussing with the software team, we realized that wrangling six servos
								was outside the scope of the project. They poses an issue because they would be under stress and would get further and further away from their starting
								position which would result in the servo no longer knowing where its home position is. This would mean that the creature would be unable to return to its original
								position and calibrating and tuning six servos would cause a lot of unnecessary complexity to our design.<br><br>
								Our new design takes a different approach. Instead of having six servos, we narrowed it down to three. These three servos will now pull down on strings attached to the frames of the 
								creature. This will mean that there will be less strain on the servos, and there will be less complexity for the software team. This changes how the creature will actuate, but it should
								still be able to make multiple organized behaviors with just the pulling of the strings.<br><br>
								One of the major concerns with this new design is tensioning the strings. Having improper tension could completely mess up the creature's ability to move so we needed to make sure
								to manage the tension appropriately. Another concern is that we needed the creature to bend uniformly throughout the frames. As you can see in the cardboard sketchmodel in the top left corner,
								without any padding inbetween the frames, only the top frame bends. We added springs in the gaps of the frames to help the creature bend uniformly.</p>
